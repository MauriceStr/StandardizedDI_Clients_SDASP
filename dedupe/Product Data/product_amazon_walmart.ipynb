Its simple design and rugged construction ensure years of dependable operation. Glass Beaded Microscopic spherical glass beads embedded in a matt white base material. Due to their spherical shape the glass beads reflect the majority of projected light back to its source. This results in a projected image which is significantly brighter than matt white within an approximate 90 degree viewing cone. The superior on-axis reflectivity of glass beaded material makes it desirable for use with low luminance projection devices including LCD platens and many LCD projectors. It should not be used with ceiling- or floor-mounted projectors. A glass beaded screen will tolerate a higher level of ambient light in the audience area. On axis gain of 2.5 and a recommended viewing cone of 90 degrees. Seamless in sizes up to 10 in height.</td>\n",

       "8529   Arkon s SM226 long flexible gooseneck windshield suction mount ideal for trucks and vans or other car s that have a long distance from the windshield to the front of the dash. The 14 inch long windshield suction pedestal features an 64mm suction base and provides maximum hold from the windshield. A circular adhesive console dash disc is also included. It allows you to attach the windshield pedestal to other areas in the vehicle such as the dash or console. Simply stick the adhesive disc in the location where you want to hold your phone and then attach the windshield suction to the flat surface on the disc. Using the adhesive is optional though as most people choose the windshield mount installation.

       "21888  206042 Size 150 diagonal A heavy-duty projection screen that is an attractive and practical choice wherever a large spring-roller screen is required. Its simple design and rugged construction ensure years of dependable operation. Glass Beaded Microscopic spherical glass beads embedded in a matt white base material. Due to their spherical shape the glass beads reflect the majority of projected light back to its source. This results in a projected image which is significantly brighter than matt white within an approximate 90 degree viewing cone. The superior on-axis reflectivity of glass beaded material makes it desirable for use with low luminance projection devices including LCD platens and many LCD projectors. It should not be used with ceiling- or floor-mounted projectors. A glass beaded screen will tolerate a higher level of ambient light in the audience area. On axis gain of 2.5 and a recommended viewing cone of 90 degrees. Seamless in sizes up to 10 in height.
